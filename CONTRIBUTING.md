# Contributing

please work on one type of subject (new design in a new file) one set of modifications to one file (correction or amelioration)
and then commit and make a pull request. 
Please dont make a pull request with several types of changes, as this get rapidly confusing.

thus, make a git branch for each set of modifications, and ask a pull request for each one of these, makes sorting out what happens immensely easier....

don't forget, that as soon the stuff is pulled up you can delete or merge your branches back!
